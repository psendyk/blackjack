# EECS C106 Fall 2019 Final Project

## BlackJack Dealer [Baxter]

##### Group Number: 41 <br>
##### Group Members: Warren Deng, Pawel Sendyk, Henry Leou, Michael Wang, Bryan Yang <br>


## Introduction
The end goal of our project was to have Baxter act as a blackjack dealer, while acting as similarly to a real blackjack dealer as possible. This meant that we wanted Baxter to be able to behave in certain ways and perform specific actions:
* Deal and flip playing cards
* Recognize playing cards and their values
* Recognize hand gestures as blackjack-specific player actions
* Play through a game of blackjack properly; including who has which cards, what the value of players' hands is, and when the game terminates
