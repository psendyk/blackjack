# EECS C106 Fall 2019 Final Project

## BlackJack Dealer [Baxter]

##### Group Number: 41 <br>
##### Group Members: Warren Deng, Pawel Sendyk, Henry Leou, Michael Wang, Bryan Yang <br>


## Introduction
The end goal of our project was to have Baxter act as a blackjack dealer, while acting as similarly to a real blackjack dealer as possible. This meant that we wanted Baxter to be able to behave in certain ways and perform specific actions:
* Deal and flip playing cards with two suction grippers
* Recognize playing cards with computer vision
* Recognize hand gestures as blackjack-specific player actions, using computer vision
* Play through a game of blackjack properly, which involves: who has which cards, what the values of players' hands are, and when the game terminates

This project had some interesting problems, the most prominent of which were how exactly to move the robot to manipilate cards, and using computer vision to both recognize hand gestures and identify card values. We had to solve what kind of forward or inverse kinematics would manipulate the card into a position where our camera could see the card, all while making sure Baxter did not inadvertently drop or otherwise reveal the dealer's facedown card. Additionally, we had to consider how to flip the cards both from the deck and from the table.
